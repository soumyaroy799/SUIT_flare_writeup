abstract={The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) provides multiple simultaneous high-resolution full-disk images of the corona and transition region up to 0.5 R⊙ above the solar limb with 1.5-arcsec spatial resolution and 12-second temporal resolution. The AIA consists of four telescopes that employ normal-incidence, multilayer-coated optics to provide narrow-band imaging of seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV) band passes centered on specific lines: Fe xviii (94 {\AA}), Fe viii, xxi (131 {\AA}), Fe ix (171 {\AA}), Fe xii, xxiv (193 {\AA}), Fe xiv (211 {\AA}), He ii (304 {\AA}), and Fe xvi (335 {\AA}). One telescope observes C iv (near 1600 {\AA}) and the nearby continuum (1700 {\AA}) and has a filter that observes in the visible to enable coalignment with images from other telescopes. The temperature diagnostics of the EUV emissions cover the range from 6{\texttimes}104 K to 2{\texttimes}107 K. The AIA was launched as a part of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission on 11 February 2010. AIA will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of solar variability and of how the Sun's energy is stored and released into the heliosphere and geospace.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Recent observations demonstrated that sunspot structure can change rapidly and irreversibly after flares. One of the most puzzling results is the increase in magnetic shear around the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line after flares. However, all these observations were made at the photosphere level. In this Letter, we study the altitude variation of the nonpotentiality of the magnetic fields associated with the 4B/X3.4 flare of 2006 December 13. The vector magnetograms with unprecedented quality from Hinode before and after the flare are used as the boundary conditions to extrapolate the three-dimensional nonlinear force-free magnetic fields and the potential fields. The former are computed with the optimization algorithm and the latter with the Green’s function method. At the photosphere boundary, magnetic shear increases after the flare in a local area close to the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line. Two measures of the magnetic nonpotentiality, the weighted mean shear θw and the total magnetic shear θwB, are calculated in this area at progressively higher altitude. By comparing their altitude variation profiles before and after the flare, we find that the nonpotentiality of the local area increases after the flare below ~8 Mm and decreases from that height to ~70 Mm. Beyond 70 Mm, the magnetic fields approach potential for both times.}

abstract={Variations in solar activity, at least as observed in numbers of sunspots, have been apparent since ancient times but to what extent solar variability may affect global climate has been far more controversial. The subject had been in and out of fashion for at least two centuries but the current need to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic causes of climate change has brought it again to the forefront of meteorological research. The absolute radiometers carried by satellites since the late 1970s have produced indisputable evidence that total solar irradiance varies systematically over the 11-year sunspot cycle, relegating to history the term ``solar constant'', but it is difficult to explain how the apparent response to the Sun, seen in many climate records, can be brought about by these rather small changes in radiation. This article reviews some of the evidence for a solar influence on the lower atmosphere and discusses some of the mechanisms whereby the Sun may produce more significant impacts than might be surmised from a consideration only of variations in total solar irradiance.},
